# c
I wrote the c language when I was 5, without help, except at debugging during compilation, because we were all learning then, and so, I want to participate in github to share what about c I know how to do, and to share how we made it. They often call me the K, the special K, in my "The C Programming Language" book.

Hello, welcome to C Programming.
This is the github repo situation for our programming creation.
We have in our timeline the work for creating another c language,
just the smaller version of that creation process. 

When we connect the dots in here, we will be arranging them to 
create and allow the creation of code that can create and destroy 
its own properties, so we don't create anything twice. And, so, we
don't teach it to do stupid things like vandalize and damage.

In the repo of this c language, we will be creating a deposit of 
reasons, the special mix and combination of words and choosing
the right letters, to make words we will be applying to a computer
that knows how to do 4 different things. I will also be making it 
on my phone, typing into text areas and compiling when and 
where I can.

Immediately as of my writing, someone has heard of this repo, 
so I have to go conduct damage control.

We will be making a language to isolate ourselves, 
as c, 
from Americans, Vietnamese, Canadians, 
Irish, Singapore, Mafia, 
Cartel and Vandalism.
The rappaport we will be removing that is vandalism is
how c is used to teach and make people move. So we can
relax and read.
